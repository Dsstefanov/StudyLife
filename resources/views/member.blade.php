                Being a volunteer in StudyLife will enable you to work together with other students which are interested in the same areas as you are. The main departments in which you will be able to volunteer, are Marketing, Design and IT. In each department there are several opportunities for you, based on what your interests are. At SudyLife we encourage everybody to implement their ideas, as long as you come with the initiative, all other members will help you achieve them. Within StudyLife, we expect the volunteers to:
